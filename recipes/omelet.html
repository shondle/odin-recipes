    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An omelet is a type of egg-based dish made by cooking beaten eggs in a pan. It can be filled with a variety of ingredients, such as cheese, vegetables, and meat, to add flavor and texture. Omelets are a quick and easy breakfast or lunch option, and can be customized to suit your taste preferences.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
      <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>Fillings of your choice (cheese, vegetables, meat, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork. Add the milk and salt, and mix until well combined.</li>
      <li>Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat. Once the butter is melted and hot, pour the egg mixture into the pan.</li>
      <li>As the eggs start to cook, use a spatula to gently lift the edges of the omelet and tilt the pan to allow the uncooked egg to flow underneath. Continue cooking until the eggs are mostly set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add your desired fillings to one half of the omelet. Use the spatula to gently fold the other half of the omelet over the fillings, forming a half-moon shape.</li>
      <li>Cook for an additional minute, or until the fillings are hot and the omelet is fully cooked. Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
