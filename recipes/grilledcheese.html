  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is a simple yet delicious sandwich made by grilling bread and cheese together until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melted. It can be served on its own or with a variety of toppings, such as tomato or bacon, to add flavor and texture. Grilled cheese sandwiches are a quick and easy meal option that can be customized to suit your taste preferences.</p>
